(attaching the screenshot of my bank transactions below) 3. i had faced a similar issue a few months back when i tried withdrawing funds from my zerodha account. at that time, i re-tried the withdrawal and somehow it got cleared. 4. after getting clarification from upstox that the rejection was made from your end, i had raised this issue through your customer complaint option/portal on 16-12-202 . i got an immediate response saying that you will get back to me in 48 hours (attaching the screenshot below). it is very disappointing that it has already been 3 days (excluding sunday) and i have not received any response from you. 5. since december 11, i was running behind upstox and now behind you to get the fund credit to my account. in this time period i am losing the interest i am eligible for + im paying interest on the other side for the capital which is a huge loss for me. again the time and effort that i have to take to raise the complaint, follow it up and escalate if needed etc. cant be explained. if the issue is not getting resolved immediately and permanently, as a privileged customer of hdfc bank and federal bank for years and having active zerodha, kotak and hdfc securities accounts for trading, i will be forced to choose the alternative options and also to escalate the issue of poor customer service and resulted financial loss to the authorities concerned. hence i request you to kindly look into it on priority and help with a permanent solution for the repeating fund withdrawal issues. regards, harisankar e. s. 9539568448 date: fri, dec 16, 2022 at 1:34 pm subject: re: [#7210123] 115724/payment/standard withdrawal/withdrawal request delayed accounts team to: > dear edasserrypushpakam, thank you for writing to us. we apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. as per the telephonic conversation, your query has been addressed. this is to inform you that your payout request of rs.7,243/- placed on 11.12.2022 and rs.16,536/- placed on 14/12/2022 has been rejected due to beneficiary name difference and the reversal tat for the same is 3 days. kindly request you to update your name with your bank. below are the reference number for both the transactions: reference number for payout of rs.7243/- is n346222244091240. reference number for payout of rs.16,536/- is n349222249046149. as we checked, your payout request of rs.31,729/- has been processed from our end and the amount has been credited to your primary bank: icici bank ltd xxxxxxxx0037 account on 15/12/2022. we request you to check the transaction details with your bank with reference number: n348222247414692. in case, if you have not received the funds in your bank account then request you to send us the bank statement till date so that we can check and assist you further. you can refer to the link below for steps on how to access and download the ledger report from our mobile application: on fri, 16 dec at 11:38 am , edasserrypushpakam sankarannambiar harisankar <harisankares22@gmail.com<mailto:harisankares22@gmail.com>> wrote: dear team, the issue is yet to be resolved and there is no response received for last two days. 1. its been 4 - 5 days since i raised a withdrawal request for amount rs. 7243 which is yet to be credited to my account. 2. adding to it , i had raised a withdrawal request for rs. 16536 two days back and it is also not credited in my account. 3. an amount of rs. 31729, which was requested for withdrawal in bw these two got credited. such a huge delay in fund withdrawal cannot be accepted as i would be losing the interest for the same amount on one side and paying the interest for the fund raised for investment on the other side. again upstox will be enjoying the interest for the extra days keep my money in your account. expecting a quick response and solution for the issues raised. else ill be forced to escalate it further. regards, harisankar e. s. 9539568448 on wed, dec 14, 2022, 4:34 pm hari sankar e.s wrote: dear team, attaching the screenshot of my bank account transactions for your reference as suggested by your customer care officer. pls help to resolve the issue and credit the amount to my account asap. on wed, dec 14, 2022, 4:18 pm upstox <support@upstox.com<mailto:support@upstox.com>> wrote: dear edasserrypushpakam sankarannambiar harisankar, thanks for reaching out to us! this is an auto-generated reply to let you know that we have received your email. allow us some time to understand your concern and get back to you with a solution on the ticket id - 7210123. need more help? check our detailed help center here. we thank you for your patience. sincerely, team upstox 7210123:11570 -- regards, harisankar e s 95395684489 "

(in interest of full disclosure, i did miss a call from +911409713607 on 30/11/19 because i was driving) in case you did call once and it was missed by me, there should have been an effort to at least call a second time/sms/email to redress the issue but there have been no such calls/emails i had similarly called a few weeks back and requested for call back but that time also no callback was received. i sent many emails but every time a new person responds and there is no ownership of the issue and no one tries to redress the grievance up to the last stage. only piecemeal information is provided without any solutions and it is left for the customer, i.e., me to run after icici..."

external email warning: do not click on any attachment or links/url in this email unless sender is reliable.

to,
rbi (reserve bank of india),
sub: change of nri account status to resident (demat account) (in300183-1262848), (in302902-4197753) .
dear sir,
this is bringing to kind attention that i am facing technical problems from bank icici bank kutchery road ajmer branch (icic0000185), pin code: 305001.  as they are unable to process the application due to unclear instructions/ rules applicable presently as per rbi instructions/rules/forms.
my name is ramesh bulchand bhatia, i was in uae from 1969 till 2001.
after returning i opened my account in icici bank branch in physical, equity forms given to credit in demat account.  at that time its considered that this account under nri status will automatically after seven years as a non resident ordinary account will be considered as resident account.
  after returning from uae in 2001 are not gone back job/ other to any other countries and rules were new for bankers also not aware of exact rules to make it as resident account.
due to long stay in uae (1969 to 2001) me and my wife (dhanwanti ramesh kumar) all investments in equity were under nri status either individual or joint name. therefore separate demat account was opened as appearing first holder in certificate,
although at the time of opening the account they had given both addresses indian as well as uae addresses.
 after many years operating account the status of account never changed also we have placed some shares (las) and taken as a loan from bank (jaipur branch) i.e. at 50% of market value at that time.
so the accounts we were operating as resident account and funds not transferred out of india but use to meet our needs as required time to time.  as loan was taken from icici securities from jaipur branch and savings account in icici direct (ajmer).
past 2, 3 years bank informed us to change the status and we have given them the forms but theres confusion of changing the status.
as we have invested small small amount in 150 scrips (equity/ shares) some in ipo as resident for 20 years of are stay in india so now its all mixed.
now concern is if we close the nri account so the scrips are in mixed form (in300183-1262848)   and second is (in302902-4197753) both with icici bank.
so we are in the opinion that rbi allow the account number remain same by changing internally from nri to resident indians so the account with companies books is not disturbed. as this account is active foam as nri status keeping the same account number it to be considered as resident indian account.
therefore the scrips will remain same and account will appear as resident india so registrar companies will be considered as resident if your good selves will simplify the procedure without any hassle as even after selling scrips our savings account will be credited which is a resident account. hence there is no clarity/dilemma of funds transfer in nri account or resident account. so we assume and expect that there is no transfer of funds as nri funds and if account number is remain unchanged with internal changes from nri to resident.
accordingly we dont have to keep this account inoperative or wait for changes which may take one month to 6 months or more as all the companies have to confirm this change in their books also.
therefore only the title of account will change from nri to resident indians.
since funds will not transferred to nri account or outside india but will be credited in resident savings account as resident is operative and all the transactions sell or purchase of or done through one savings account.
kindly let us know about your views (opinion) without disturbing change physically as 23 years has passed which is quite a long period. to change the account number only we need to change the status (title) only in books this will save time and unnecessary correspondence. and we can avoid delay as theres no physical exchange of funds.
kindly considered this matter in top priority as the deadline is approaching on 31st march 2023.
awaiting for your immediate attention (response).
 thanking you.

dear icici bank (fraud bank)

its very shameful that our money is not safe in this bank. you are cheating and doing fraud by issuing debit cards without applying and deducting the charges.

on 27th march 2023, rupees 116.82 deducted my account number is 298401000920 and when i called and asked customer care number, he told me that you requested a new debit card telephonically. its very shameful and ashamed that i never called and did not  request any debit card while i was already using a debit card ending **500 and 706.82 rupees deducted for the same.

dear fraud bank, refund my 116.82 rupees with penalty immediately, otherwise its not good for you..........

i am writing to report for a fraudulent transaction that was made on my debit card without my knowledge. i was shocked to discover that a transaction was made on my card without the use of my pin.its a very serious issue how for a bank to authorize the use of debit card without a pin, as the pin is the very important crucial security feature that helps protect the cardholders funds from fraudulent transactions.

the transaction in question was made on 2nd february 2023 there were multiple transaction made by my debit card (approx 18 transaction) for the amount of rs 8720, and i have not done this transaction in any way.i suspect that my card details may has been misplaced and used by any unauthorized person.since its my salary account i use this only less frequently only when i have to make very important transaction.

i would like to request an immediate investigation into this matter,and reimburse the fraudulent amount back to my account. i also request that you take necessary steps to prevent any further unauthorized transactions from being made on my account.i have attached a copy of my transaction history for your review.

also i have already made the complaint and send the details on 8th february 2023 by calling to the customer care and blocked my debit card and they asked be to report the disputed transaction team i have called them multiple times and said that they have done it but when i checked from bank only your card has been blocked and no issue reported.

so, if the complaint has been filed, please share the reference number for my complaint so that i can track its progress, as well as the details of the complaint with my registered email address and no. i would also appreciate it if you could provide me with regular updates regarding the status of this investigation till now, as i have not received any single update regarding the same on my registered mail id and no.

hi

received a call today from one of the relationship manager that i will be charged 450 rupees and to avoid that i need to get a transaction done. i have asked him to call me later but he told me its urgent and he also made reference to a mandatory transaction to be done respect to my lic ipo purhase and made me login to my account and do the below

1. made me purchase sbi stock of 1 quantity and sell it.
2. made me purchase prime membership with the promise that i wont be charged 299 for it and only gst charges will be applicable. asked this multiple times and promised me.
3. made me purchase neo membership as one time fee to avoid any brokerage charges in the future.
4. made me buy 21 stocks of ongc and sell it to check on brokerage charge. (he told me later that he mentioned 1 and i have made it 21)
5. deallocate 615 rupees  i had for my equity portfolio funding in 2 transactions of 500 and 115


after all this he didnt do anything about lic ipo which he promised he will help out initially.

post call he said as i didnt do any transaction this financial year he has to step in  to support me to evade this when i asked multiple times of being charged only gst. then i told  him i had bought most stocks in my portfolio only this financial year. he didnt have an answer and promised i will not be charged for prime and only for neo.

now when i check my net banking, i have been charged 299 and gst for both neo and prime membership. its a surprise. i m not sure what happened to my deallocated funds of 615, nowhere to be found. not sure what he wanted to do for lic ipo transaction he missed that part.

if i had invested that 700 plus rupees i lost today because of some employee in icici directs greed into stocks it would have made sense. for a beginner like me, stock market becomes difficult when people cheat us like this. i m with icici since 2011 and things like this make me lose confidence in all services offered.

expecting a positive response.

thank you

shyamala
