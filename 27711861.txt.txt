Hi Team,

This is not right. I have explained everything that this is not my number. I never given any request to change the number. My original number is 9891599648.
I used to get otp on same number. I know I can get this fix by visiting nearest branch. However I will not visit because this is not my mistake.

First of all, Is there anyone who can tell me who changed my phone number? How it's difficult to understand that someone change my personal information from bank data base.

Frankly speaking, you are forcing me to go at next level. I got call on same number 9891599648 and I have been told that my number will be updated very soon.

Thanks &Regards
Vivek Mishra
